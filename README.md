# Advanced Blender addon for exporting

***

# What I want this addon to do:
1. Duplicate all visible meshes
2. Make all instances real
3. Apply all modifiers and apply custom normals so the meshes look exactly like the do in the export as they do in Blender
4. Rename UV maps to map1, map2 etc so UV maps the combined mesh doesn't add UV maps
5. Combine all meshes by parent empty
6. Export all combined meshes as separate fbx files with custom settings for Unreal Engine
7. Delete all exported meshes
